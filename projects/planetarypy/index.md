The PlanetaryPy Project is a community effort to develop a core package for planetary science in Python and foster interoperability between Python planetary science packages.
The PlanetaryPy Technical Committee (TC) is the governing body for the PlanetaryPy Project.
All of their work is done in the open via the TC GitHub repo.

To learn more about what the TC is, how it operates, or to get involved, you can read its Charter.
The PlanetaryPy TC has regular meetings to which all are welcome to attend.
The meeting agendas for upcoming meetings, and notes from previous meetings can be found in the TCâ€™s GitHub repo.
