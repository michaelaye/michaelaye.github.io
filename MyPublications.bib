  abstract = {We present a novel alternative to the use of glass mirrors on ground based Cherenkov telescopes. Glass mirrors, whilst having excellent imaging characteristics, can become a limiting factor in the design of such telescopes, due to their weight and expense. We produce mirrors using an innovative vacuum forming process (global patent applied for), using only aluminium materials. The result is a mirror weighing and costing a fraction of that of a glass mirror. The method of production is described together with preliminary results of the shape conformity and repro ducibility. The properties of the reflective surface are outlined, including robustness and specular reflectivity. This is shown to be superior to its glass equivalent particularly at wavelengths relevant to Cherenkov radiation.},

  abstract = {Several atmospheric monitoring instruments have been installed at the H.E.S.S. gamma-ray observatory in Namibia. Firstly, Heitronics KT19 infrared radiometers, aligned paraxially with the H.E.S.S. telescopes, measure the infrared radiation of the water molecules. These allow us to detect clouds crossing the telescopes' field of view and to estimate the humidity present in the atmosphere. For a general estimate of the atmosphere's transmittance, i.e. the detection of any light-attenuating aerosols, a ceilometer, which is a LIDAR with built-in atmospheric data reduction code, is being used. It will be complemented soon by an instrument which will measure the transmissivity of the atmosphere at different wavelengths up to 500m above the ground. The overall status of the weather is monitored by a fully automated weatherstation. This paper describes the setup, the data analysis and how this will be used in order to improve the knowledge of the telescopes' effective collection area.},

  abstract = {The Diviner Radiometer on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is measuring surface temperatures in 7 different thermal channels, 4 of them in the wavelength area classically defined as far infrared, starting at 13 microns, and ending with the longest wavelength channel at 400 microns. The surface temperatures derived from these thermal infrared measurements at the lunar poles indicate some of the coldest temperatures measured in the solar system of around 20 K. This work aims to disprove the null hypothesis that other effects like wavelength and temperature dependent emissivities are responsible for a reduced radiant exitance and the subsequently low derived surface temperature. To address the wavelength dependency of emissivity we are comparing nighttime temperatures over time (cooling curves) in between the different far infrared channels at selected locations. The locations have to be selected for low rock abundance to minimize anisothermality effects influencing the cooling curves. For this we are applying the method of lunar surface rock abundance using Diviner data as described in Bandfield et al. (2011), that has not been done so far at latitudes poleward of 60°. To avoid the large influence of slopes on the surface temperatures, the main reason for the latitude restriction in Bandfield et al. (2011) we use recent LOLA altimeter data to resolve any slopes that could influence the cooling curve at a chosen location. Having selected a location relatively free of anisothermalities and taking their effect into account, general differences in the cooling curves of the different Diviner wavelengths are interpreted as wavelength-dependent emissivities. To address the potential temperature dependency of emissivity, we are studying how the parameters of a mid-temperature range exponential fit to the cooling curve fit from approx. 250 to 70K, where we do not expect a temperature dependence of emissivity, extends to highest and lowest temperatures at the poles. Failure to make the high or low ends of the cooling curve fit to the extrapolated shape of the mid-temperature curve indicates a change of emissivity. Lastly, these studies should compare locations where we expect a potential emissivity effect from surface frosts. Chosen locations close to each other and under the assumption of comparable lateral heat conductivity at these close locations, surface deposits of ices should have a measurable effect on the emissivity. Studying this could further support two of Diviner's exciting hypotheses of water ice deposits in craters at the pole, and having measured some of the coldest temperature in the solar system.},

  abstract = {The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has been used to monitor the seasonal evolution of several regions at high southern latitudes. Of particular interest have been jet-like activities that may result from the process described by Kieffer (2007), involving translucent CO2 ice. These jets are assumed to create fan-shaped ground features, as studied e.g. in Hansen et.al. (2010) and Portyankina et.al. (2010). In Thomas et.al. (2009), a small region of interest (ROI) inside the south polar Inca City region (81° S, 296° E) was defined for which the seasonal change of the number of fans was determined. This ROI was chosen for its strong visual variability in ground features. The mostly manual counting work showed, that the number of apparent fans increases monotonously for a considerable amount of time from the beginning of the spring time observations at Ls of 178° until approx. 230° , following the increase of available solar energy for the aforementioned processes of the Kieffer model. This fact indicates that the number of visual fan features can be used as an activity measure for the seasonal evolution of this area, in addition to commonly used evolution studies of surface reflectance. Motivated by these results, we would like to determine the fan count evolution for more south polar areas like Ithaca, Manhattan, Giza and others. To increase the reproducibility of the results by avoiding potential variability in fan shape recognition by human eye and to increase the production efficiency, efforts are being undertaken to automise the fan counting procedure. The techniques used, cleanly separated in different stages of the procedure, the difficulties for each stage and an overview of the tools used at each step will be presented. After showing a proof of concept in Aye et.al. (2010), for a ROI that is comparable to the one previously used for manual counting in Thomas et.al. (2009), we now will show results of these semi-automatically determined seasonal fan count evolutions for Inca City, Ithaca and Manhattan ROIs, compare these evolutionary patterns with each other and with surface reflectance evolutions of both HiRISE and CRISM for the same locations.

  abstract = {Saturn's most massive ring, the B ring, has been divided into five regions based on the radial structure of its optical depth (Marouf et al. 2006, BAAS 38, 552). Regions B2 and B3 contain the locations with the highest optical depths. The Cassini UVIS HSP observed 15 occultations of the bright UV star Beta Centauri (Hadar). Several regions in the B ring core are opaque to Hadar with transparencies of less than 0.002 at the 10-m radial resolution of the occultations. These opaque regions are separated by irregular structures with embedded narrow ({$<$} 100 m) features with transparencies on the order of 0.1-0.2. The boundaries of the opaque regions are circular, but within each of the opaque regions there are multiple non-axisymmetric windows where the transparency jumps to as much as 0.2 on spatial scales of less than 50 m. The two brightest stars in the Hadar system contribute comparable amounts to the observed HSP signal. The projected separation of these stars in the ring plane is typically tens of meters in both the radial and azimuthal directions allowing us to measure or constrain the dimensions of these narrow openings we dub "phantoms" due to their similarity to the completely transparent "ghosts" identified in the C ring plateaus (Baillie et al. 2013, Astron. J. 145, 171). High resolution images of these regions reveal non-axisymmetric structure on larger spatial scales. The number and dimensions of the phantoms varies between the opaque regions. Phantoms do not appear at the same location in different occultations, suggesting that they are due to local particle dynamics rather than any large-scale instability or perturbation. Embedded boulders or miniature moonlets, like the propeller objects seen in the A ring (Tiscareno et al. 2006, Nature 440, 648; Tiscareno et al. 2019, Science 364, 1054) have been proposed to explain the C ring ghosts. Further work will be needed to determine if similar objects in the dense B ring can explain phantoms as well as the source of the larger inhomogeneities seen in Cassini images.}

  abstract = {The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) highspeed photometer (HSP) measured photon count rates in the wavelength range of 110─190 nm with sampling rates of 1─8 ms during its lifetime. Over the course of the Cassini mission to Saturn, the UVIS HSP recorded photon count rates for 276 stellar occultations of Saturn's main rings. These stellar occultations trace a 1 dimensional path through the rings, and due to the high sampling rate of the UVIS HSP, the azimuthal and radial resolution are on the order of the Fresnel scale (√λD), about 10 m [1, 2] in the frame of the ring particles. Stellar occultations are offset widely in time and azimuth, but by combining autocorrelations of the occultation time series, we develop a 2-D autocorrelation of the temporally and azimuthally averaged structure at a given ring radius. 2-D autocorrelations allow us to study the rings on the scale of the largest individual particles in the rings. Ring particles aggregate and disperse creating self-gravity wakes [3, 4] as well as what has been referred to as "streaky texture", "feathery texture", and "straw" [5] in Cassini images which have pixel scales as low as 300 m in the frame of the ring particles. By comparing autocorrelations from the UVIS HSP stellar occultations with images from Cassini Imaging Subsystem (ISS), and n-body simulations we determine the properties of the mesoscale structures at a given ring radius. Mesoscale structure refers to agglomerations of particles which are bigger than the largest individual ring particles but smaller than a few km. We directly measure the length, width, and orientation of self-gravity wakes as well as the wavelength of viscous over-stable waves both of which are significantly smaller than the pixel scale in Cassini ISS images. 1: Jerousek et al. 2020, Icarus, 344, 113565. ; 2: Colwell et al. 2018, Icarus, 300, 150-166. ; 3: Colwell et al. 2006, Icarus, 190, 127. ; 4: Hedman et al. 2007.

  abstract = {Fan-shaped deposits on top of the seasonal polar caps are routinely observed by HiRISE to emerge in spring and fade in summer [Hansen et al. 2010]. These fans are widely accepted to be a result of CO2 jet eruptions [Kieffer, 2007], and therefore fan lengths, sizes, and shapes provide information about wind directions and strengths at the times such eruptions occur. Seasonal monitoring observations reveal how this process evolves throughout a season and over multiple martian years, and thus inform us about martian climate. Fans were outlined by citizen scientists in the frame of the Planet Four (P4) project at 27 regions of interest (ROIs) around the southern polar region. The analysis of P4 data successfully produced information on wind directions and speeds at those ROIs for the spring season of two martian years (MY 29 and 30) [Aye et al., 2019]. The seasonal fan markings change considerably from one HiRISE image to another at most of these ROIs, and thus consequent temporal variations in wind speeds and directions can be derived. We have, for the first time, compared observed wind directions and speeds derived from P4 with near-surface winds predicted by a mesoscale atmospheric model (MRAMS [Rafkin and Michaels, 2019]) at the same ROIs. At most ROIs P4 winds are broadly consistent with the winds from MRAMS, but the detailed level of consistency varies between different ROIs. This indicates strong influences of local topography and nearby larger-scale features on the local wind patterns. The spatial resolution of HiRISE images (and thus P4 data) is superior to that of any atmospheric model that can be run in a realistic amount of time. Some ROIs thus present additional challenges to the atmospheric simulations because of their smaller-scale topographical features that would deflect near-surface winds. Nevertheless, the fact that the P4 observations and MRAMS winds match at most ROIs supports the hypothesis that fan formation is greatly controlled by the wind, and not just due to ballistic trajectories of material exiting an angled vent. At the same time, the fact that at other ROIs the model cannot satisfactorily match the P4 data even where the topography is generally unremarkable indicates that the model may be missing some important physical process/effect and more work still needs to be done to better understand these CO2 jet phenomena. In summary, HiRISE and consequently P4 data provide new unique near-surface wind data points for both validating atmospheric modeling and quantitatively investigating Mars' polar seasonal processes. 1: Aye, K.

  abstract = {Araneiforms are radially converging systems of branching troughs exhibiting fractal properties. They are found exclusively in the Southern polar regions of Mars and believed to be result of multiple repetitions of cold CO2 gas jets eruptions. Araneiform troughs get carved by the overpressurized gas rushing underneath a seasonal ice layer towards a newly created opening. Current work is an attempt to quantitatively analyze araneiforms patterns and model their formation mechanism. Araneiform shapes range from small and simple structures of one or two connected branches to intricate dendritic patterns several kilometers across. The dendritic quality of most araneiforms are suggestive that they can be described in terms commonly applied to terrestrial rivers. The main difference between rivers and araneiforms from the morphological point of view is that araneiform patterns are not directed or in any way influenced by the local gravitational gradient. We have adapted and for the first time applied to Martian araneiforms qualitative morphological analysis typically used for terrestrial rivers. For several locations in the Martian Southern polar regions we have calculated the largest order of tributaries, tributary densities, and bifurcation ratios. We have shown that the large and well-developed araneiforms (with tributary orders larger than 4) closely follow Horton's law of tributary orders and have bifurcation ratio that falls well inside the range of terrestrial rivers. We have implemented a two-dimensional Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) model that describes formation of dendrite shapes by mathematical probabilistic means. We compared modeled dendrite shapes to the araneiform shapes observed in the Martian polar regions and evaluated their similarity using the morphological analysis of araneiforms. We showed that DLA model can successfully recreate 2D shapes of different observed araneiforms. To simulate the patterns that deviate from central symmetry it is required to modify the main governing parameter of DLA model: its two-dimensional probability field. An analog to the governing probability field in the case of araneiforms is the gas pressure in the cavity underneath the ice layer right before the gas starts moving towards the newly created escape vent. Thus modeling the creation of araneiform patterns with DLA leads to better understanding of seasonal processes that create them.},

Our goal was to condense CO2 directly from the chamber’s atmosphere onto a specially designed cooling plate. We investigated ranges of temperatures and pressures similar to those in Martian polar areas, observed the texture of the created CO2 ice layer, and measured its optical properties. Most importantly, we find that under conditions usual for Martian polar areas in fall and winter, CO2 ice always deposits as a translucent slab. The maximum thickness of the ice that we have achieved approached 2 cm and this CO2 slab ice layer was either transparent or highly translucent. Under significantly lower temperatures or in states away from equilibrium (for example, when CO2 gas input into the chamber was fast and created over-pressure) CO2 deposited as different crystalline structures. In this case, when a thick layer was created, it was not visually transparent. However, even in those cases it still retains some level of translucency. Our results will advance the analysis of remote-sensing data related to CO2 ice, Mars’ seasonal cycles, and various models considering CO2 ice condensation-sublimation related processes.},

  abstract = {The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Or-biter (MRO) is presently (February 2010) observing its second northern spring on Mars. Com-plimentary spectral information from CRISM is available to gain insight into the composition and physical state of the surface. In the north polar areas, there are active regions. Here, dark dunes extend almost circumferen-tially around the permanent polar cap. This area exhibits phenomena similar to those observed in south polar areas in southern spring. Among these phenomena are cracks in a translucent ice layer which are considered to be manifestations of ice damage by increasing pressure at the interface between the ice layer and substrate underlying it [1]. Bright and dark fans, attributed to cold jet activity, are also observed on top of dunes [2]. The presence of these features indi-cates that dunes are covered by a conformal ice layer and that this layer is at least partially transparent to solar radiation. CO2 ice sublimation and processes connected to it appear to produce a variety of observable features. Yet another distinctive feature observed in this area (and rarely present in the south) is the presence of dark slope streaks on dunes. They originate from the crests of dunes and run down following the gravitational potential. They lengthen as the season progresses. Their origin has been discussed to be possible liquid brine flows [3, 4]. In the present work we report on indications that these slope streaks are instead dry mass wasting process. Due to geometry of solar illumination at local latitude the energy input on the crest is higher than in the valley between dunes. The ice cover thins most quickly in areas closest to the crest. In addition, applying stress distribution calculations to the conformal ice layer on realistic dune geometry, we show that the crest of the dune is the weakest point for the ice bending stress. The rupture of the ice layer therefore happens close to the dune's crest on the slip face and is followed by the escape of dry dune material from its top layer downslope. Streaks are overlaid on the ice layer and produce the observed contrast changes. Seasonal lengthening of the streaks can be attributed to the repeatability of this process when more and more dune material gets freed from the ice layer. An enhancement of this effect can occur if the rupture of the ice layer gives rise to an escape of gas trapped under it. The gas pressure, in this case, is produced by the same process that is proposed for araneiform formation in south polar areas [5]. Gas movement mobilises fine dune material and transports it towards the slip slope whereupon it runs down the slope. The described model does not involve liquid flows but is nonetheless fully consistent with HiRISE observations of this phenomenon. [1] G.

  abstract = {We present an overview of our analyses of HiRISE observations of spring evolution of selected dune areas of the north polar erg. The north polar erg is covered annually by seasonal volatile ice layer, a mixture of CO2 and H2O with mineral dust contamination. In spring, this layer sublimes creating visually enigmatic phenomena, e.g. dark and bright fan-shaped deposits, dark–bright–dark bandings, dark down-slope streaks, and seasonal polygonal cracks. Similar phenomena in southern polar areas are believed to be related to the specific process of solid-state greenhouse effect. In the north, it is currently unclear if the solid-state greenhouse effect is able to explain all the observed phenomena especially because the increased influence of H2O on the time scales of this process has not yet been quantified. HiRISE observations of our selected locations show that the ground exhibits a temporal behaviour similar to the one observed in the southern polar areas: a brightening phase starting close to the spring equinox with a subsequent darkening towards summer solstice. The resolution of HiRISE enabled us to study dunes and substrate individually and even distinguish between different developments on windward and slip face sides of single dunes. Differences in the seasonal evolution between steep slip faces and flatter substrate and windward sides of dunes have been identified and compared to CRISM data of CO2 and H2O distributions on dunes. We also observe small scale dark blotches that appear in early observations and tend to sustain a low reflectivity throughout the spring. These blotches can be regarded as the analogue of dark fan deposits in southern polar areas, leading us to the conclusion that both martian polar areas follow similar spring evolutions.},

  abstract = {For the first time, model-derived and imagery-derived wind directions and speeds have been compared in Mars’s south polar region. Seasonal fan-shaped deposits are routinely observed by HiRISE in the polar regions. They are widely accepted to result from CO2 gas jet eruptions. Fan lengths, sizes, and shapes can provide information about wind directions and strengths at the times such eruptions occur. We utilize a catalog of those fan-shaped deposits, marked by citizen scientists within the framework of the Planet Four (P4) project, at 27 regions of interest (ROIs) for two spring seasons (Mars years 29 and 30). Fans change considerably from one HiRISE image to another at most of these ROIs as wind direction changes over the spring season. Leveraging this characteristic, intraseasonal variations in near-surface wind speeds and directions were retrieved and compared to near-surface winds predicted by a mesoscale atmospheric model (MRAMS) at the same ROIs. At most ROIs P4-inferred wind directions are consistent with those from MRAMS. The P4-derived wind speeds are less constrained but are consistent with MRAMS wind speeds at the majority of ROIs. The overall consistency between the P4-inferred and MRAMS wind directions supports the underlying assumption that fan formation is controlled by the wind and is not simply due to ballistic trajectories of material exiting suitably nonvertical vents. Measurements of seasonal fan-shaped deposits in HiRISE imagery can thus provide important intraseasonal information about near-surface winds—invaluable for both validating climate modeling and quantitatively investigating Mars’s polar processes.},

  abstract = {Here we report on the detection of new dendritic troughs created by the seasonal CO2 jet activity over several Martian years. According to Kieffers hypothesis (Kieffer, 2007) in Martian polar areas seasonal CO2 ice sublimation creates gas jets that deposit fans of mineral dust and sand on top of the CO2 ice. These jets and the related sub-ice gas flows are believed to carve troughs in the underlying polar deposits which, after multiple repetitions of this process throughout Martian spring seasons, create araneiform terrains. The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) detected the new troughs during its campaign for seasonal monitoring of the polar areas. The newly detected dendritic troughs are small shallow branching troughs (≈ 1.4 m wide) similar to the seasonal furrows previously detected in the northern hemisphere (Bourke, 2013). The essential difference between the new troughs and furrows lies in the fact that the troughs in the south are persistent while the northern furrows are erased each Martian year by the sand movement due to summer winds. From year to year the new southern troughs extend and develop new tributaries and their overall geometry turns from linear to dendritic, a characteristic shared with araneiform terrains. We believe that furrows have the same origin as the southern dendritic troughs but do not develop into dendritic shapes because of the high mobility of the dune material into which they are carved. Several locations where new dendritic troughs are observed lie in the vicinity of dunes. This gives us an observational indication that presence of erosive sand material is an important factor in creating (or at least starting) erosive processes that lead to the formation of dendritic troughs. By extrapolation the same mechanism should be acting to create the much larger araneiform terrains. Detection of the present day erosion working in polar areas and creating new topographical features is important for understanding of the processes that shape polar areas. Several years of HiRISE observations provide us with the information about the current rate of erosion and hence help estimate minimum ages of the araneiforms and the surface into which they are carved to be 1.3 × 103 Martian years.},

  abstract = {Martian polar areas in spring display a variety of surface changes. The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) routinely observes the surface evolution of polar regions on Mars. The amount and quality of the data collected over the last 6 Martian years provide abundant information about the seasonal and inter-annual development of transient surface features - fans and blotches - considered to be deposits from CO2 jet eruptions. These deposits consist of material that has been eroded from underneath the seasonal ice layer, propelled tens of meters or more into the atmosphere by pressurized jet eruptions, and then directed by local near-surface winds as it falls to the ground. Thus, the morphology of such deposits contains information about eruption physics as well as about the state of the martian atmosphere at the time of eruption. Assuming the jet eruptions are near-vertically directed, the blotches are thought to form when local near-surface winds are nearly calm, and the fans are directed downwind of the jet vent (with lengths proportional to the wind speed). To analyze the relevant portion of the HiRISE dataset quantitatively, we have created the citizen science project Planet Four (P4). Online participants of P4 mark seasonal deposits in sub-frames of HiRISE images by outlining fans. Locations, directions, and sizes of the markings are stored in a database. We have created a pipeline for processing that database, removing mistaken markings and reducing multiple markings of the same object to one marking per object. The complete description of the P4 project and the pipeline can be found in Aye et al. (2019). The result of the pipeline is a catalog of fan and blotch markings that provide direct information about wind directions and speeds in the locations observed. The fan directions shift considerably during spring and also with location, reflecting the complex nature of weather in the springtime southern polar region. We will present P4-derived wind speeds and directions in multiple regions of interest (ROIs) in the southern polar region. We have run the Mars Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (MRAMS) at the same locations and season to compare its results to values derived from P4. The MRAMS model results are generally consistent with P4 wind directions and speeds. There are several ROIs where MRAMS fails to simulate the observed wind directions. The complexity of nearby topography, together with differences in spatial resolution between observations and model, are the primary causes for this discrepancy. For most ROIs, MRAMS winds are most consistent with the observed fan directions in early spring (until approximately Ls 200°). This can be explained by the increasingly close proximity of the sublimating edge of the seasonal polar cap (and associated more-stochastic weather) as spring progresses. Fan directions coincide with (modeled) day-time winds in early spring. Conclusions: The P4 analysis of HiRISE imagery provides us with a new way to investigate seasonal atmospheric processes on Mars, along with the potential for quantitative analysis. The broad consistency of the modeled winds with that derived from the fan deposit observations indicates that the fans mark the directions of the constantly changing near-surface winds, rather than reflecting simple ballistic trajectories from an angled eruption vent.}

P4T enlists members of the general public to visually identify features in the publicly released Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Context Camera (CTX) images. In particular, P4T volunteers are asked to identify: (1) araneiforms (including features with a central pit and radiating channels known as ‘spiders’); (2) erosional depressions, troughs, mesas, ridges, and quasi-circular pits characteristic of the South Polar Residual Cap (SPRC) which we collectively refer to as ‘Swiss cheese terrain’, and (3) craters. In this work we present the distributions of our high confidence classic spider araneiforms and Swiss cheese terrain identifications in 90 CTX images covering 11\% of the South polar regions at latitudes ≤ −75° N. We find no locations within our high confidence spider sample that also have confident Swiss cheese terrain identifications. Previously spiders were reported as being confined to the South Polar Layered Deposits (SPLD). Our work has provided the first identification of spiders at locations outside of the SPLD, confirmed with high resolution HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) imaging. We find araneiforms on the Amazonian and Hesperian polar units and the Early Noachian highland units, with 75\% of the identified araneiform locations in our high confidence sample residing on the SPLD. With our current coverage, we cannot confirm whether these are the only geologic units conducive to araneiform formation on the Martian South Polar region. Our results are consistent with the current CO2 jet formation scenario with the process exploiting weaknesses in the surface below the seasonal CO2 ice sheet to carve araneiform channels into the regolith over many seasons. These new regions serve as additional probes of the conditions required for channel creation in the CO2 jet process.},

  abstract = {An approach is presented to efficiently produce high quality gridded data records from the large, global point-based dataset returned by the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment aboard NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The need to minimize data volume and processing time in production of science-ready map products is increasingly important with the growth in data volume of planetary datasets. Diviner makes on average {$>$}1400 observations per second of radiance that is reflected and emitted from the lunar surface, using 189 detectors divided into 9 spectral channels. Data management and processing bottlenecks are amplified by modeling every observation as a probability distribution function over the field of view, which can increase the required processing time by 2–3 orders of magnitude. Geometric corrections, such as projection of data points onto a digital elevation model, are numerically intensive and therefore it is desirable to perform them only once. Our approach reduces bottlenecks through parallel binning and efficient storage of a pre-processed database of observations. Database construction is via subdivision of a geodesic icosahedral grid, with a spatial resolution that can be tailored to suit the field of view of the observing instrument. Global geodesic grids with high spatial resolution are normally impractically memory intensive. We therefore demonstrate a minimum storage and highly parallel method to bin very large numbers of data points onto such a grid. A database of the pre-processed and binned points is then used for production of mapped data products that is significantly faster than if unprocessed points were used. We explore quality controls in the production of gridded data records by conditional interpolation, allowed only where data density is sufficient. The resultant effects on the spatial continuity and uncertainty in maps of lunar brightness temperatures is illustrated. We identify four binning regimes based on trades between the spatial resolution of the grid, the size of the FOV and the on-target spacing of observations. Our approach may be applicable and beneficial for many existing and future point-based planetary datasets.},

Previous study of this area using data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), Diviner and LAMP instruments aboard Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) shows a spatial correlation between brighter 1064 nm albedo, annual maximum surface temperatures low enough to enable persistence of surface water ice ({$<$}110 K), and anomalous ultraviolet radiation. We present results using data from Diviner that quantify the differential emissivities observed in the far-IR (near the Planck peak for PSR-relevant temperatures) between the PSR and a nearby non-PSR target in Amundsen Crater. We find features in far-IR emissivity (50–400 μm) could be attributed to either, or a combination, of two effects (i) differential regolith emissive behavior between permanently-shadowed temperature regimes and those of normally illuminated polar terrain, perhaps related to presence of water frost (as indicated in other studies), or (ii) high degrees of anisothermality within observation fields of view caused by doubly-shaded areas within the PSR target that are colder than observed brightness temperatures. The implications in both cases are compelling: The far-IR emissivity curve of lunar cold traps may provide a metric for the abundance of “micro” cold traps that are ultra-cool, i.e. shadowed also from secondary and higher order radiation (absorption and re-radiation or scattering by surrounding terrain), or for emissive properties consistent with the presence of surface water ice.},

  abstract = {We present cloud-tracking results from Venus nightside images with velocity errors approaching 1 m/s (rms). The cloud-tracking scheme focuses on 1) reducing the errors associated with Venus disk registration and 2) modeling cloud feature trajectories over a succession of images. Venus disk registration errors are reduced to within 0.25 pixels with a combination of limb detection from radial-gradients and robust rejection of outliers. Cloud tracking trajectories are modeled as simple functions of latitude and longitude using Advection Corrected Correlation Image Velocimetry (Asay-Davis et al., 2009). The cloud-tracking methods are then applied to two unique datasets to investigate cloud processes and global atmospheric circulation on Venus. The first dataset consists of an 18-hour time series of images with one-hour intervals of Venus' nightside at 1.74, 2.26, 2.32 μm acquired by the JAXA Akatsuki mission on August 25, 2016: these images were deconvolved to remove scattered light and improve acuity (Vun, 2020). The second dataset consists of images acquired by the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and the Nordic Optical Telescope during coordinated campaigns in June and July 2020.
