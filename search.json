    "text": "Some basic facts to understand\nA few facts that help to understand what’s going on below:\n\nOverall and very approximately (but sufficiently), conda is exactly 2 things:\n\nA package/library getter\nA path manager enabling easy switching between different Python environments.\n\nThe command conda activate used below simply creates a temporary PATH variable pointing the system’s search for executables into your currently activated conda environment.\nThe conda command line tool is increasingly being replaced by the faster mamba tool.\n\nmamba is a drop-in replacement for conda, so for all commands you just replace conda with mamba.\nHowever, mamba is still using conda underneath, so don’t uninstall it, you need both!\nOnly install mamba into your base environment.\n\nThat’s for people who read this and want to add mamba to their system.\nNew starters should use below’s installer that exactly does that.\n\nAlso, there’s a few remaining commands that still run smoother using conda, so if mamba is giving you a hard time, just try the same command parameters using conda instead of mamba\n\nconda/mamba environments are ALWAYS going into user space, never ever should you require root/superuser access.\n\nUnless you are an admin that installs a systemwide environment for many users.\n\nconda gets its packages from so called channels, and there’s a community channel called conda-forge that most of us are using successfully for years.\n\nThe installer linked below will configure to use the conda-forge channel all the time (hence the name mambaforge), but you can always change that later, and, winningly, configure this to be different per environment!\nIt is recommended to not install packages from different channels into the same environment\n\nCreating new environments is fast and cheap (hard-links between downloaded packages when used in more than one environment.)\n\nSo, when in doubt if you should install a potentially dodgy Python package into your main work environment, maybe better and simply just create a new one (see commands below)."

    "text": "Installation instructions\n\nInstalling base\nSo, here we go:\n\nDownload the script-based installer for your operating system here:\n\nFor a Unix-like platform like macOS and Linux, execute these commands, they will first downlad the right installer and then run in:\nwget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\nbash Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\n\nRestart the shell (exit -&gt; open new one)\nCheck that you have the conda and mamba command available:\n\nwhich conda\nwhich mamba\nThey should both point to your chosen install folder + /condabin.\n\n\nInstalling your main work environment\nNow you are good to go to:\n\nCreate your main work environment.\n\n\nI DO NOT recommend to work in the base environment, because that’s used for managing all envs, so if you mess up in there, you loose all other envs as well (potentially). This is actually very similar to the old advice on the Mac to not work with the system Python, because the OS was using it for management tasks.\n\nSo, let’s say you want to create a Python 3.8 environment as your standard &gt; 3.9 is also fully supported for science analysis I’d say, just some dev tools don’t like it yet.\nI usually call my main envs by the python version that’s installed in there, so in this case:\nconda create -n py38 python=3.8\nAfter that’s executed successfully you need to activate it:\nconda activate py38\nand NOW we change to use mamba because the packages we like to install need to be checked for each other’s dependency requirements which is the time consuming task at which mamba excels so much.\nLet’s say we want to install some important basic science packages:\nmamba install pandas scipy astropy jupyterlab nb_conda_kernels\n\nnb_conda_kernels is an extremely useful package that helps you to easily switch between conda envs inside jupyter notebooks\n\nThis install command will now churn and come back with a HUGE list of packages to install because those packages are what your wanted ones are based of.\nYou should confirm the choices by typing return (or y) and then mamba will download quite fast in parallel the required packages and make them available to your current env.\n\n\nPIP installs\nWhat if the package of your choice isn’t available on conda-forge? (mamba search &lt;pkg_name&gt;)\nThen you could install it from pypi.org using pip.\n\nUnfortunately, pip installs still in 2021 can mess up your conda envs. :(\n\nHaving said that, with a bit of care I manage to mix a lot of PIP installs into my conda envs without any issues. Here is my strategy:\n\nNOTE: Activate the conda env where you need the pip things BEFORE you start installing with pip! It’s one of the most frequent problems for Python beginners to have not done that and then have pip installed new packages somewhere where you didn’t expect it to be.\n\n\nFind out what other packages the pip package depends on and install as many of them as possible via mamba/conda.\nAs the last step, if possible, only install your required package via pip, like pip install nbverbose for example.\nDon’t worry if there’s other packages coming in, that part works just like in conda.\n\nLet me repeat above advice again in other words as it’s really that important:\n\npip is “current path dependent”.\n\nThat means, you have to activate the conda env where you want things to end up in, because then the PATH points to the right pip.\nYes, every conda env has its own pip command.\nAlternatively, you can use the full path to the pip command you should be using, but I find that to be quite more scary and less user-friendly for new terminal users, which is why I prefer my above advice to simply always activate the env where you want things to install.\n\n\nHope this helps someone!\nLet me know if you have any questions or suggestions in the linked Twitter thread!\nComment"

    "text": "Mamba is a CLI tool to manage conda environments and a drop-in replacement for the conda CLI tool. It is built in C/C++ and hence resolves package dependencies much faster than the Python-coded conda.\nIt also offers parallel downloads for new or updated packages, so that updating your environment or adding a new package isn’t a chore anymore, it’s blazing fast! :)\nYou install it (only!) into your conda base environment like so:\nconda activate base\nconda install -c conda-forge mamba\nWhen creating a new Python system, I can recommend to go immediately for the new mambaforge installer, that will:\n\ninstall mamba into your base so that it is immediately available\npoint all your package requests to the awesome conda-forge channel where a huge community provides all the scientific Python packages and dependencies (like gdal and OpenCV) in a much faster update cadence then the defaults channel of anaconda does.\n\nI am working exclusively with the the conda-forge channel for several years and never, or very rarely, had an issue with that.\n\nJust remember: Don’t mix channels much, the less the better. (It’s okay for a one-time mamba install into your base though.)\n\nComment"

    "title": "Integrate Zigbee Tuya Thermostats into Home Assistant",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Disclaimer\nLet me start by saying that my only work in this knowledge gathering was the combination of several internet searches. The real genius lies in the group of people creating the below-to-be-installed quirk files to get new devices working in ZHA. I just thought, as it isn’t very straight forward to understand what one needs to do, that I summarize things in this small blog post\n\n\nLet’s go!\nI bought some Tuya thermostats on AliExpress after it became clear that Tuya products are well supported now in Home Assistant (HA). And I wanted them to be Zigbee only and not buy another hub from Tuya. There are 2 ways to integrate them, apparently, either with the ZHA Zigbee implementation or via Zigbee2Mqtt. But the latter would require another plugin, which I wanted to avoid for now.\nThe thermostats I bought are these and after an initial joining to the ZHA of HA, no usable entities appeared related to the thermostat.\nSo I had to search the HA forums for solutions. I learned that for finding solutions to Zigbee issues one needs to search for the manufacturer ID string that is displayed in the ZHA Device info display:\n\n\n\nManufacturer string shown after “by”\n\n\nThe manufacturer string is shown after the “by” below the general product ID TS0601, and in my case the manufacturer string is _TZE200_6rdj8dzm.\nSearching for this string one can learn that if a Zigbee product isn’t (fully?) supported yet by ZHA, one can install so called quirk Python files that add the translator dictionaries required for understanding the Zigbee devices’ communication.\nFirst, one needs to create a quirk folder on your Home Assistant device, in my case that’s a Raspberry 4 running the HA OS, but it shouldn’t matter.\nTo manipulate files on my HA install, I use the File Editor Add-on which I can highly recommend. If you decide (again, recommended) to add the File Editor entry to the sidebar, it should look like this when clicking on the folder icon in the upper left of the Add-On:\n\nThe second icon at the top offers you to add a new folder. Make sure that you create the new folder in /config, at least that’s what I saw recommendend, maybe it doesn’t matter due to the next step, where we tell HA where the quirks folder is.\nUsing the same File Editor we now open the famous /config/configuration.yaml to add the following to it:\nzha:\n  enable_quirks: true\n  custom_quirks_path: /config/quirks\nif you create a new folder named quirks in your /config folder.\nNow you put the unzipped Python file from here into that folder. If you had previously connected the thermostat to ZHA, now is a good time to remove it, as you have to reboot HA anyway to activate the new quirk.\nAfter a reboot, put the thermostat into pairing mode again and connect it, you should have now several useful entities:\n\nLooking at the Controls section, the switch called Lock is called Switch at first, but it is for the child lock, so I renamed it to Lock. The 2nd entry Number Temperat... is very handy, it’s a slider for 1 degree offsets to calibrate the measured temperatur of the thermostat, and they gonna need it! Mine was 3 degrees off from an external temp sensor I mounted on top of the thermostat handle.\nHope it helps!"

    "text": "Goals and objectives\nThis project will create an open source, Python-based tool capable of reading the vast majority of data (including tables and images) and metadata formats currently archived by the PDS, as well as some formats common in planetary science research workflows but not typically archived in PDS (e.g. ISIS cube, JP2, GeoTiff). It will offer users a consistent, easily-understandable interface that works the same way for all data formats. For instance, a simple command like read(filename) will return a Python object that can immediately be used in research workflows or easily converted to other formats using pre-existing tools.\nThis tool solves a well-known pain point for planetary data users: simply figuring out how to access data, especially data archived under PDS3, which often have inconsistent or bespoke formats. PDS is in the process of migrating archives to the stricter PDS4 standard, but the timeline for this migration is uncertain, and it is unlikely to be completed before 2025. The tool developed under this project provides a stopgap solution and also supplements the migration effort in two important ways. First, reading PDS3 data formats is one limit on a swift and efficient data migration, so this tool will streamline that effort. Second, because this tool will treat PDS3 and PDS4 data identically from the end-user perspective, it will future-proof research workflows from the migration."

    "text": "Approach and methodology\nThis effort will build on proof-of-concept work already undertaken by this team. The majority of data archived under PDS3 (including .DAT and .IMG files) use a bitwise structured format sometimes referred to as the “PDS3 format.” It is not dissimilar from the FITS file format, but suffers from a much looser definition, leading to difficulties reading these files. The major issues in PDS3 that we have identified are (1) inconsistent mapping between specified data types and byte-size / order, (2) complex files containing multiple or mixed data types, and (3) file format definitions that are not stored in standard locations. We have prototyped solutions to these three issues, and the work plan will involve fully developing and testing those solutions. Other issues arise less frequently (e.g. one-off “bad” files, unique formats) and will be dealt with case-by-case.\nSeveral Python tools exist for reading subsets of planetary data. They include pds4_tools, PVL, Plio, Python wrappers for GDAL and fitsio, Pysis, and SpiceyPy, astropy. These will be reused when appropriate, with input and output syntax / behavior wrapped to provide consistent experience across data types.\nA thorough testing suite will also be developed which, in addition to more targeted approaches, will scrape PDS data holdings in a systematic way to verify expected behavior and identify issues requiring additional development. The resulting tool will be released under a permissive license and made publicly available on the PI’s institutional webspace and the NASA PSD Github. It will be made available for easy installation through pip and conda and also submitted as an affiliate package to the PlanetaryPy project."

    "section": "Project summary",
    "text": "Project summary\nWe propose to apply a variety of image processing techniques to observations of Saturn’s rings made by the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) and the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) to investigate a previously unexpected aspect of Saturn’s rings: non-axisymmetric mesoscale structures that are larger than individual particles or self-gravitating clumps of particles and smaller than regular structures such as ringlets, density waves, and bending waves.\nISS images of the C ring reveal unexpected texture indicating structures spanning about 1 km in ring radius and several tens of km in the azimuthal direction. The nature and amount of this texture in the images varies across the C ring. Similar texture is seen in the outer portion of the B ring as well as within density waves in the A ring. UVIS observed a series of special stellar occultations that had very low velocities in the local ring particle frame (“particle tracking occultations”). These provide uniquely high resolution for non-axisymmetric structures.\nUVIS also observed many occultations of binary stars where the two stars’ separation distances projected in the ring plane span 10’s of m to a few km. These occultations are ideally suited for studying mesoscale structures. By analyzing changes in the auto-correlation of the occultation light curve we can measure changes in ring optical depth at a given ring plane radius since the two stellar components cross that radial position at different longitudes. The combination of multiple UVIS occultations at different viewing geometries, both in ring elevation and azimuth, make it possible to study not only the sizes and distribution of mesoscale structures but also their three-dimensional shapes.\nWe will incorporate analysis of the higher order moments of the UVIS stellar occultations as well as carry out N-body simulations of the rings using a well-tested collisional and self-gravitating model developed by Co-I Lewis. We will forward model the rings and reproduce the textured structure seen in ISS images as well as occultation signals of non-axisymmetric structures. We will test the effects of particle density, particle size distribution, and local embedded perturbers (giant boulders or miniature moonlets) to understand the conditions required for formation of these structures that likely include both large-scale aggregates or density enhancements as well as azimuthally-limited gaps or holes in the rings.\nWe will compare these results with observations made across the ring system including “straw” in density waves in the A ring and various streaky texture identified in images across the main rings. We will compare the simulations with particle-tracking occultations throughout the main rings to better understand the differences in ring particle properties across the system. Comparisons of both occultation data and high-resolution imaging data with simulations will show the effects of particle properties, distance from Saturn, local ring surface mass density, and effects of gravitational perturbations from external satellites and embedded moonlets.\nWe will search for evidence of secular changes in these structures to better understand the evolution of the system. Results from our analysis will constrain long-term evolutionary models of the viscous spreading of the rings as well as ring erosion and pollution models. The results of this research will thus help us address fundamental questions about the origin of the rings, such as whether the different main ring regions have a common or separate origin."

This will realize enormous gains and scientific efficiency in working with UVIS data. The proposed work will spare researchers beyond the UVIS team countless hours dealing with unnecessary technical issues and allow them to concentrate on scientific analysis. This work benefits all aspects of study related to UVIS observations: * stellar and solar occultations of Saturn, * emissions from the Titan atmosphere, * satellite reflectance, * ring spectroscopy, and more."

    "text": "This post is making use of the speedtest command line version of Ookla’s speedtest tools, which you can get here for various OSes: https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli\nSpecifically, I was looking for a linux solution, and while it’s straight forward on the Mac, where the --csv flag produces a CSV string that includes a proper timestamp of the measurement, the interface or API for the homebrew CLI versions of Mac and Linux are quite different.\nOn macOS, one can do\nspeedtest --csv\nand the output will contain a column with a timestamp which is important for keeping track of the measurements.\nOn Linux, however, for getting a CSV output, one needs to do\nspeedtest --format=csv\nand unfortunately here we do NOT get a timestamp in the output. There is the option to use --format=json which actually does provide a timestamp, but I don’t want to deal with JSON parsing for this simple thing.\nSo I added some bits of Python to catch the output of speedtest and add a timestamp to its CSV line before appending it to a record of measurements.\nThe sh package is a very useful one-file package that enables you to call system programs in a function-like manner, with proper redirection utilities of any incoming output etc. BTW, I tried to simply work with the returned object, but it wasn’t simply the text, it was some kind of CommandObject and the docs are not clear on how to get the text out of the command object, probably easy but I didn’t inspect it. So maybe below script can be made even easier, without a callback function but directly working with the returned object.\nThe header line by the way one can get by adding the --output-header flag to the above command. I then just went ahead and added , time to the header line, so that the header is complete for a quick pandas import down the road.\nNote that the numbers of speedtest are bytes/s, so one does need to do some math to convert to the usual Mbps.\nHere’s my script:\n\n\nUpdate:\nI forgot to add how to run it regularly using crontab:\nExecute\ncrontab -e\nand an editor should pop up.\nThe first cryptical looking syntax of crontab, the service that enables you to regularly execute any program or script on your machine is actually pretty simple, HelpUbuntu has a good intro here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto\nIn short, to run a script every hour on the minute 22 you put this into your crontab file:\n22 * * * * /path/to/script/to/run.py\nHope it helps someone. If anybody wants to see how to quickly analyze and plot the file using pandas let me know, but I figure most of my readers will know that?\nLet me know, put any questions or comments you may have on my Twitter feed!

    "text": "I wrote this blog post 2 weeks ago, but I wanted to show the IPython notebook in its full glory, so I got delayed posting this until I finally had finished my Blogger blog transition to a static website blogging system that supports the display of IPython notebooks. So, the excitement that hopefully still transpires, is not as fresh, but nonetheless: Mars is right now producing fans every day somewhere! I updated all times below to have more relevant data to show.\n\n\n\nI realised today that we are so close to the official beginning of Martian southern spring, I wondered if the sun already is up over Inca City. Here is how I go about finding out what’s currently going on there, using tools that I have written over the years.\nFirst I make my main library for this, kmaspice, available to me.\nfrom pymars import kmaspice\nNow I will create an object that knows how to deal with Martian times and illuminations.\ninca = kmaspice.MarsSpicer()\nI saved some predefined places and their locations into the code, so that I don’t need to remember the coordinates all the time. So let’s justify the variable name by actually setting it on top of Inca City: \ninca.goto('inca')\nBy default, when I don’t provide a time, the time is set to the current time. In the UTC timezone, that is:\ninca.time.isoformat()\n'2014-08-05T13:47:44.441759'\nTo double-check how close we are to spring time in the southern hemisphere on Mars, I need to look at a value called \\(L_s\\) (L sub s), which is the solar longitude.\nThis value measures the time of the seasons on Mars as its angular position during its trip around the sun. And southern spring was defined to be at \\(L_s = 180^\\circ\\).\nround(inca.l_s, 1)\n173.2\nSo, we are pretty close to spring then. But do we already have sunlight in Inca? We should remember that we are in polar areas, where we have darkness for half a year, just like on Earth. Let’s have a look what is the local time in Inca:\ninca.local_soltime\n(22, 27, 23, '22:27:23', '10:27:23 P.M.')\n(The output provides me with 3 different formats for the same, just in case I need that)\nRight, that’s in the night, so that most likely means that the sun is below the horizon, right?\nSolar angles are measured from the local normal direction, with the sun directly over head being defined as 0. Which means the horizon is at 90 degrees.\nI am calling up on a value with the name dsolar which is my shortcut for solar angle in degrees.\nround(inca.illum_angles.dsolar, 1)\n100.5\nSo, this value of 100 means the sun is below the horizon. But it is local night, so we would expect that!\nNow comes the magic, let’s just advance the time by a couple of hours, usually the sun is highest around local noon, so let’s aim for that. I don’t need to be precise now, so I go just 14 hours forward in time. Then I will have another look at the sun’s angle.\ninca.advance_time_by(14*3600)\nround(inca.illum_angles.dsolar)\n84.0\nOh yes! This is just 6 degrees above the horizon, the sun is lurking over it just a tiny bit. But all you people that work so hard in helping us out know what this means, right? Where there is sun, there is energy. And this energy can be used to sublime CO2 gas and create the wonderful fans we are studying. Let’s make this a bit prettier with a bit more insight. First, let’s go back the 14 hours again.\ninca.advance_time_by(-14*3600)\nNow, I will create a loop with 100 elements, and check and write down the time each 10 minutes (= 600 seconds). I save the resulting numbers in 2 new arrays to have it easier to plot things over time later.\ntimes = []\nangles = []\n\nfor i in range(100):\n    inca.advance_time_by(600)\n    times.append(inca.local_soltime[3])\n    angles.append(inca.illum_angles.dsolar)\nI’m now importing the pandas library, an amazing toolbox to deal with time-series data. Especially, the plots automatically get nicely formatted time-axes, which is always a pain with plotting.\nimport pandas as pd\ndata = pd.Series(angles, index=times)\nI need to switch this notebook to show plots inside this notebook and not outside as an extra window, which is my default:\n%pylab inline\nPopulating the interactive namespace from numpy and matplotlib\ndata.plot()\n&lt;matplotlib.axes.AxesSubplot at 0x115ac1e90&gt;\n\n\n\npng\n\n\nHere we see how the sun’s angle is developing over time. As expected we see a minimum (i.e. highest sun over horizon) right around noon. ###Do you hear the CO2 ice crackling?? ;) I find it amazing to know that in approx. 8 hours some of our beloved fans are being created!\nNext I wondered how long we already have the sun lurking over the horizon. For this I now will go backwards in 10 minute steps, but this time I take 4000 steps to cover more time. I then immediately plot the results:\ntimes = []\nangles = []\n\nfor i in range(4000):\n    inca.advance_time_by(-600)\n    times.append(inca.time)\n    angles.append(inca.illum_angles.dsolar)\npd.Series(angles,index=times).plot()\n&lt;matplotlib.axes.AxesSubplot at 0x1162d1590&gt;\n\n\n\npng\n\n\nInteresting! Now we can see that around July 14th, the sun for the first time was below an inclination angle of 90, meaning that’s the first day of this season when it lurked over the horizon.\nSo for 3 weeks now, the available energy is slowly building up CO2 gas underneath the CO2 ice cover that is everywhere. I could bet that at some place with weak thin ice, already the first fans are popping up. Unfortunately, the light conditions at local times of 2-4 PM, when our favorite camera HiRISE is flying over these places, were still so bad then, that we did not plan any images at that time.\nBut from now on it’s possible and we have indeed new observations planned. And YOU can choose which one the HiRISE team will focus on get ready for public release, just vote here: http://www.planetfour.org/vote/"

I then immediately plot the results:\ntimes = []\nangles = []\n\nfor i in range(4000):\n    inca.advance_time_by(-600)\n    times.append(inca.time)\n    angles.append(inca.illum_angles.dsolar)\npd.Series(angles,index=times).plot()\n&lt;matplotlib.axes.AxesSubplot at 0x1162d1590&gt;\n\n\n\npng\n\n\nInteresting! Now we can see that around July 14th, the sun for the first time was below an inclination angle of 90, meaning that’s the first day of this season when it lurked over the horizon.\nSo for 3 weeks now, the available energy is slowly building up CO2 gas underneath the CO2 ice cover that is everywhere. I could bet that at some place with weak thin ice, already the first fans are popping up. Unfortunately, the light conditions at local times of 2-4 PM, when our favorite camera HiRISE is flying over these places, were still so bad then, that we did not plan any images at that time.\nBut from now on it’s possible and we have indeed new observations planned. And YOU can choose which one the HiRISE team will focus on get ready for public release, just vote here: http://www.planetfour.org/vote/"

    "text": "If you are a heavy matplotlib user, you are bound to have seen the funny offset numbers in the top left of the plot window:\n\nThey are obviously there to help the viewer focus on the level where the numbers are really changing, removing the area where there’s no change happening.\nBut I am claiming that due to pattern recognition, there are quite a few cases where this confuses more than it helps. In this example I (and the people in my team) are used to see 5-digit numbers and it takes quite some time to figure out here, that these are indeed 5-digit numbers.\nTherefore I researched how to switch this behavior off.\nFirst, one imports the ScalarFormatter class from the matplotlib.ticker module:\n\nfrom matplotlib.ticker import ScalarFormatter\n\nThen, one creates a formatter object with the use of offset numbers switched off:\n\ny_formatter = ScalarFormatter(useOffset=False)\n\nFinally, you apply it to an axis object that you either receive via the fig.subplot() command, via plt.gca() (acronym for Get Current Axis) or you catch it when it is being returned after a plot command:\n\nax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(y_formatter)\n\nThere you go, hope this helps someone.\nHere is the stackoverflow issue that helped me to find the solution.\nUpdate (2013-10-20) :\nAn easier way is to catch the axis object from the plot command and apply the following command:\n\nax.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False)\n\nI initiated a github issue to have this included in matplotlib, which has been responded already with a solution, so this will be configurable in the future, yay!\nUpdate 2, same day:\nWeird, I thought I had the above shortcut working at some time, now it doesn’t. If anyone knows the circumstance under this can work and can not, please comment."
