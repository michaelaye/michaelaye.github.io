## Who am I?

- Coding-inclined planetary scientist
  - Worked on: Dawn, Cassini, BepiColombo, LRO, MRO, MEX 
  - Worked as/on:Ground ops, Onboard software, Project Manager, Calibration, Data analyst 
- Fighter for open-source, open-data, open-science
  - If I can't reproduce with public data and public code: 
    - -> at best *smelly*.
- Worked at: MPS, UBe, UCLA(JPL/NASA), LASP(CU), Freie Uni Berlin.

## Disclaimer

- I understand: an archiving budget and a "make things easy for the user"-budget aren't the same numbers, propably not even close.
  - And I appreciate that most stakeholders are formally paid only for archiving.

## What are the most prevalent types of data searches?

This is really a question I have, do we have data on this?

Candidates, IMHO:

- by product / observation ID
- by coordinates (space or time)
- by observation geometry / illumination conditions
- browsing (I'm really wondering how much this is done with an archive interface)

## One of my perfect use cases

- Read a paper using Cassini ISS
- see a product ID N1454725799
- use an API to download the data
  - for example:
  ```{python}
  #| echo: true
  from planetarypy.ciss import ISS
  iss = ISS("N1454725799")
  iss.download_calib()
  ```

## Testing for a set of data search types

- By product / observation ID  (Is there a difference sometimes?)
  - HRSC PID h6980_0000 (taken from a paper)
  - Cassini ISS N1454725799
- By coordinates (space or time)
- Browsing

# ProductID (PID) searches

## PSA (HRSC)

![](./psa_hrsc_welcome.png)

## PSA continued
- googled "ESA PSA"
  - googling "PSA HRSC" not working, "PSA HRSC data" better, but not direct
- very quick to filter for one instrument or mission (1 entry/click)
- product ID filter is not shown immediately, distinction "Basic/Advanced" a bit small.
- tried to use "Observation ID" to find "h6980_0000" using
  - h6980_0000
  - h6980_0000*
  - "h6980_0000"
  - nothing worked.
- chose random other product for D/L testing, worked very smoothly. (zip)

## Geosciences / ODE (HRSC){.scrollable}

- googled "pds hrsc data", 1st hit
- welcome view also tough to parse
![](./ode_hrsc.png)

## ODE continued

1. picking "Mars Orbital Data Explorer"
1. because i heard about, otherwise very tough
1. data product search
1. Esa's Mars Express
1. HRSC
1. calibrated data (simply choosing HRSC not possible?)
1. filter by product ID
1. "h6980_0000*" gives 9 results
1. View results in table

## Mars ODE{.scrollable}

![](./ode_hrsc_2.png) 

## Rings Node{.scrollable}
- googled "pds rings node"
- clicked on OPUS (guided well by one of 1st sentences)
![](./rings_welcome.png)

## Rings Node continued{.scrollable}
1. cassini iss
1. PDS constraints (not that easy to realize but i guess "guessable")
1. PDS3 Product ID
1. N1454725799
1. Browse results (not too easy to realize)
![](./opus_results.png)

## Rings Node continued (results page)
1. clicked on 1 results
1. preview shown
1. pressing spacebar to enter it to shopping cart got spinning wheel
  - but cart got filled
1. go to cart
1. choose from download options

## Atmosphere Node{.scrollable}

- googled "pds atmospheres"
![](./atmo1.png)

## Atmosphere cont.
1. Cassini Archive
1. ISS
1. Find info on PDS Image Atlas (the search engine)
1. pick mission
1. pick insterument
1. find/enter PDS Archive Constraints (again, weirdly named?)
1. one result shown
1. clicking gives promising buttons
1. choosing "Full Product" starts to stream binary code into the browser, WTH??
   - even worse, right-click -> save as does not work with the button.

## Atlas download options
![](./pds_atlas_download_options.png)

# Coordinates search

## ODE (HRSC)

Lat -85, -80,

Lon 10, 20
 
gives 509 results and no issues.

## PSA (HRSC)

Same coordinates as ODE.

Gives error message:

- please select a target with an available map
