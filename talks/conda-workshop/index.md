abstract: I will explain the basic principles of the conda-based toolset, 
  recommend best practices for using conda environments and channels, and demonstrate techniques 
  on how to efficiently delete and reinstall everything in under 5 minutes. 
  I also will discuss Python software package discovery and installation strategies in 
  relation to these conda environments and how to efficiently develop your own 
  libraries while being part of a conda environment.
