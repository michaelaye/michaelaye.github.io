## What is Citizen Science (CS)?
(quotes from EU Horizon monthly focus:)

* "Through citizen science, ordinary people can take part in extraordinary research."
* "Through their contributions, the citizen scientist can actively pursue personal values, and be part of a research community seeking the same goals."
* "The professional scientist can get more data than they would otherwise. This leads to better precision in their measurements and more lines of enquiry in their research."
* "Environmental monitoring is a particularly active field of citizen science."
* "Scientists naturally want to measure the effects of citizen science and its impact on society [...]" (Meta-CS)

## Why Citizen Science?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}
### Good for science:
* amount of data grows exponentially
  * ideal for simple but arduous questions
* ML: labeled data always better
  * CS is an efficient way to create many labels
* good outreach opportunity

### Good for the public:
* good outreach opportunity
  * participate in real science
    * independent of prior education!
  * wide variety of research fields open up to CS
