# What is Citizen Science (CS)?

## Political answer (Quotes EU Horizon monthly focus)

* "Through citizen science, ordinary people can take part in extraordinary research."
* "Through their contributions, the citizen scientist can actively pursue personal values, and be part of a research community seeking the same goals."
* "The professional scientist can get more data than they would otherwise. This leads to better precision in their measurements and more lines of enquiry in their research."
---
* "Environmental monitoring is a particularly active field of citizen science."
* "Scientists naturally want to measure the effects of citizen science and its impact on society [...]" (Meta-CS)

## What is CS, practically?

* Problem: Simple, but arduous or repetitive task
  * too much data to go through yourself
* Split up the task into screen-sized subtasks
* Present the data with a simple workflow to thousands of untrained volunteers

## What is in it for scientists?

* amount of data grows exponentially
* ideal for simple but arduous questions
* ML: labeled data always better
* CS is an efficient way to create many labels
* good outreach opportunity

## What is in it for citizens?
  * participate in real science
  * independent of prior education!
  * wide variety of research fields offered as CS now

## Recognition of the field (US) {background-image="US_projects.png" background-opacity="0.2" background-size="contain"}

* <https://science.nasa.gov/citizenscience>
* Seed funding available through standard NASA funding programs
* Can be attached to larger project applications

# How did it start (really) {background-image="galaxyzoo.png" background-size="contain" background-position=""}

* [Zooniverse](https://zooniverse.org) really took off with "GalaxyZoo"
* Dozens of papers before planetary even started
* Galaxy shape distributions needed  
  redefinition!

# Planet Four project {background-image="section1_APF0000hmm.png" background-opacity="0.85"}

## Science case {background-image="image6.jpeg" background-size="contain"}

## Science case temporal {background-image="image17.jpeg" background-size="contain"}


## Science case: Kieffer model
![](image14.jpeg)

* Jet deposits are aligned by prevalent winds at the time!
* Mapping these features would be more wind data than we ever had on Mars!

## Active areas around south pole
![](rois_map.png)

* Seasonal campaigns at most of these areas!
  * -> Lots of huge HiRISE image data

## Input data
* 221 HiRISE images from MY 29/30
* split up into over 40,000 image screen-sized tiles
* Tiles are being "anonymized", to prevent bias
* The data input and reduction pipelines need to track everything

## Interface {background-image="section3_marking_tools.png" background-size="contain"}

## Interface return
![Difficulty: What (contrast) defines the "end" of a surface feature?](fan_markings.png)

Minimum of 30 different volunteers per image tile!

=> quite slow progress

## Reduction pipeline {background-color="white"}
![Comprehensive description in @ayePlanetFourProbing2019 : "Planet Four: Probing springtime winds on Mars by mapping the southern polar CO2 jet deposits"](parameter_scan.png)


## Reduction pipeline 2 {background-color="white"}
![Clockwise from upper left: 1) Raw, 2) Fan markings, 3) Blotch markings, 4) Blotch reduction, 5) Fan reduction, 6) catalog entry with 50% majority vote](image23.png)

## Catalog entries
![](image7.png){.absolute left=0}
![](image8.png){.absolute left=500}

## Science Team (Gold) markings
* Each team member marked several hundred tiles
* Significant differences between science team members
* Years of experience do **not** overcome the original contrast problem!

## {background-image="gold_data114.png" background-size="contain"}

## Compare experts with citizens
![](gold_blotch_areas_common.png)

## Results

* Over 40,000 citizens have contributed
  * Most only once
  * Core team of approx 10-20 volunteers did most of the work
* ca. 400,000 geo-located objects in catalog
* available at <https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mschwamb/planet-four/about/results>

## What can be done with it?

![@portyankinaPlanetFourDerived2022 "Planet Four: Derived South Polar Martian Winds Interpreted Using Mesoscale Modeling"](image13.gif)

## Compare with climate models 
* Team member Tim Michaels nest GCM into high-res meso-scale models using CTX and HiRISE DTM topography
* Run for several days to avoid "spin-up" effects
* Run at different $L_s$ over the season
* Compare wind predictions with Planet Four data
* Just published in @portyankinaPlanetFourDerived2022

## {auto-animate=true}
![](image10.png){.absolute top=-250 left=0 width=1000}

## Measure of success
* Define status of good / average / bad fit with data
* Using only direction very good match with climate models
* Taking into account wind strength as well less good
* Our assumptions for jet deposit <-> wind strength are too simple

## {background-image="image11.png" background-size="contain"}

Only wind directions

## {background-image="image12.png" background-size="contain"}

Wind directions and estimated strengths

## Conclusions

* Citizen Science is not only outreach
* Scientific paradigms are being changed thanks to the work power of hundred thousands of citizen scientists all over the world
* If data reduction is done carefully, the results are very reliable
* Don't try to do this "on the side"
  * It's a full time analytical job
* Overall good match with models but discrepancies exist
* Hope to derive jet eruption times
