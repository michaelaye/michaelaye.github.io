# What is Citizen Science (CS)?

## Political answer (Quotes EU Horizon monthly focus)

* "Through citizen science, ordinary people can take part in extraordinary research."
* "Through their contributions, the citizen scientist can actively pursue personal values, and be part of a research community seeking the same goals."
* "The professional scientist can get more data than they would otherwise. This leads to better precision in their measurements and more lines of enquiry in their research."
* "Environmental monitoring is a particularly active field of citizen science."
* "Scientists naturally want to measure the effects of citizen science and its impact on society [...]" (Meta-CS)

## What is CS, practically?

* Problem: Simple, but arduous or repetitive task
  * too much data to go through yourself
* Split up the task into screen-sized subtasks
* Present the data with a simple workflow to thousands of untrained volunteers

## What is in it for scientists?

* amount of data grows exponentially
* ideal for simple but arduous questions
* ML: labeled data always better
* CS is an efficient way to create many labels
* good outreach opportunity

## What is in it for citizens?
  * participate in real science
  * independent of prior education!
  * wide variety of research fields offered as CS now

## Recognition of the field (US)
