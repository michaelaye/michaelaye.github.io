# What is Citizen Science (CS)?

## Political answer (Quotes EU Horizon monthly focus)

* "Through citizen science, ordinary people can take part in extraordinary research."
* "Through their contributions, the citizen scientist can actively pursue personal values, and be part of a research community seeking the same goals."
* "The professional scientist can get more data than they would otherwise. This leads to better precision in their measurements and more lines of enquiry in their research."
---
* "Environmental monitoring is a particularly active field of citizen science."
* "Scientists naturally want to measure the effects of citizen science and its impact on society [...]" (Meta-CS)

## What is CS, practically?

* Problem: Simple, but arduous or repetitive task
  * too much data to go through yourself
* Split up the task into screen-sized subtasks
* Present the data with a simple workflow to thousands of untrained volunteers

## What is in it for scientists?

* amount of data grows exponentially
* ideal for simple but arduous questions
* ML: labeled data always better
* CS is an efficient way to create many labels
* good outreach opportunity

## What is in it for citizens?
  * participate in real science
  * independent of prior education!
  * wide variety of research fields offered as CS now

## Recognition of the field (US) {background-image="US_projects.png" background-opacity="0.2" background-size="contain"}

* <https://science.nasa.gov/citizenscience>
* Seed funding available through standard NASA funding programs
* Can be attached to larger project applications

# How did it start (really) {background-image="galaxyzoo.png" background-size="contain" background-position=""}

* [Zooniverse](https://zooniverse.org) really took off with "GalaxyZoo"
* Dozens of papers before planetary even started
* Galaxy shape distributions needed  
  redefinition!

# Planet Four project {background-image="section1_APF0000hmm.png" background-opacity="0.85"}

## Science case {background-image="image6.jpeg" background-size="contain"}

## Science case: Regions

## Science case: Kieffer model

* Jet deposits are aligned by prevalent winds at the time!
* Mapping these features would be more wind data than we ever had on Mars!

Difficulty: What (contrast) defines the "end" of a surface feature?
