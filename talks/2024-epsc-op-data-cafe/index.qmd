# Who am I, Michael Aye?

- Coding-inclined planetary scientist, participated in several space missions (Dawn, Cassini, BepiColombo)
- Fighter for open-source, open-data, open-science
  - If I can't reproduce with public data and public code, I consider published works at best *smelly*.
- Worked at MPS, UBe, UCLA(JPL/NASA), LASP, Freie Uni Berlin.

# What is OpenPlanetary?

![](./op_header_about.png)

## Practically speaking

We are 

* a Slack forum (possibly changing soon-ish)
* an open discussion forum
  * publicly searchable
  * <https://openplanetary.discourse.group/>)


## Our Mission

Our [mission](https://www.openplanetary.org/about) is 

- to promote and facilitate the open practice of planetary science and data analysis for professionals and amateurs 
- by organizing events and conducting collaborative projects aimed at creating scientific, technical and educational resources, tools and data accessible to all.
  - e.g. monthly OP Virtual Lunch talks

## OUR STORY
- started back in 2015 from an initial participants effort to stay connected and share information related to and beyond the ESA’s first Planetary GIS Workshop. 
- continued during the 2nd USGS Planetary Data Workshop, and aggregated more people.
- In 2018, established non-profit organisation, to provide a legal framework to sustainably fund our community framework, projects and activities, and better serve the planetary science community as a whole.

## People

- co-founded by presiden Nicolas Manaud and US counter-part Chase Million (https://www.openplanetary.org/about)
- we have a board of directors with shared responsibilities
- Slack channel has > 800 members from all over the world
- you can find many planetary scientists, planetary data experts, software developers, directly involved in the tools you use every day

## Covered topics by members
- channels for PDS, PSA, ISIS, GDAL, PlanetaryPython, SPICE, conda, mapping, jupyter, machine-learning, cloud, docker, QGIS, and more.
- folks directly involved in the tools you use every day: GDAL, ISIS, PDS, SPICE, PSA, ASP, PlanetaryPython, etc.

## Forum

- to preserve and make searchable / findable discussions of general interest to the community:
- <https://openplanetary.discourse.group/>

# Software stack

If you are new to planetary science, you might not be aware of all the tools and resources available to you. (OP can help with that! #tools channel)

Here's a quick overview of the planetary science software stack.

## Software virtual environments

- Despite some challenges and learning curves, many people recommend conda environments as the most sustainable way to manage software dependencies in our field of science.
- Don't listen to your IT departments, when they say, you can do everything without conda. (convince them otherwise ;) ) 
  - GDAL still today is the dealbreaker, requires more work than really necessary.
  - There are a few other libraries that have similar issues.

### conda/mamba

- ISIS requires conda anyway, so why not use it for everything?
- I have created a *_"minimal reading"_*blog post for conda environments:
  - <https://michaelaye.github.io/posts/minimal-conda-setup-instructions/>
- There's also a presentation that might need some updates but contains general truths
  - <https://michaelaye.github.io/talks/2021-conda-workshop-kharkiv/>
- In short: Use mamba, via the conda-forge channel, enjoy life. 

## Planetary Python

- We are an organization as well:
  - <https://planetarypy.org/>
  - We have code of conduct, regular technical meetings, trying to establish a core package for standard tasks in planetary python.
- I have a large-ish chaotic package, that is being transferred to the organization, piece-by-piece, in a peer-review fashion.
- slowly growing community package: <https://github.com/planetarypy/planetarypy>

### Demo 

- Show SPICE and Index functionality
